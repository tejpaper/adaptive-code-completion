    \shortcaption{Performance scaling beyond context extension window (\textit{infile})}{Evaluation of the performance scaling beyond the context extension window. The \textit{infile} line type from the LCA benchmark is selected for visualization; the corresponding \figureref{fig:beyond-training-window-inproject} presents results for the \textit{inproject} category. ``1K'' refers to 1,024 tokens. The \raisebox{-0.3ex}{\FiveStarOpen} markers denote the context length used during repository-level pre-training stage.}\label{fig:beyond-training-window-infile}
